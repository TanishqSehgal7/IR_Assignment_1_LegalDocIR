CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
 
No. 04Œ1140. Argued November 8, 2005ŠDecided De cember 7, 2005 
In removing petitioner Martins™ state-court class action to federal court 
on diversity gr ounds,  respondents (collectively, Fran klin) ac knowl-

edged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of 
the state-court complaint, but argued that this requirement for fed-
eral diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless sa tisfied under precedent 

suggesting that punitive damages and attorney™s fees could be aggre-
gated in making the calculation.  The District Court denied the Mar-
tins™ motion to remand to state court and eventually dismissed the 

case with prejudice.  Reversing and remanding with instructions to 

remand to state court, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins 
that their suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy require-
ment and rejected Franklin™s aggregation theory under decisions is-

sued after the District Court™s remand decision.  The latter court then 
denied the Martins™ motion for attorney™s fees because Franklin had 
legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within federal-court ju-

risdiction.  Affirming, the Tenth 
Circuit disagreed with  th e Martins™ 
argument that attorney™s fees should 
be granted on remand as a mat-
ter of course under 28 U. S. C. §1447(c), which provides that a re-

mand  order ﬁmay require payment of just costs and any actual ex-
pen ses, in c lu din g attor n ey fees,ﬂ bu t pr ovides li ttle gu idan c e on  w h en  
fees are warranted.  The court noted 
that fee awards are left to the 
district court™s discretion, subject to review only for abuse of discre-
tion; pointed out that, under Circuit precedent, the key factor in de-
ciding whether  to award fees is th
e prop riety of removal; and held 
that, because Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held 
to be unsound, its basi s for removal was objectively reas onable, an d 
the fee denial was not an abuse of discretion. 
Held:
 Absent unusual circumst ances, att orney™s fees should not be

awarded under §1447(c) when the removing party has an objectively 
reasonable basis for removal.  Conversely, where no objectively rea-
sonable basis exists, fees 
should be awarded.  
This Court rejects the  
Martins™ argument for adopting a strong presumption in favor of 

awarding fees.  The reasons for 
adopting such a presumption in

are absent here.  Also rejected is Franklin™s argument that 
§1447(c) sim p ly gra nt s court s jurisd ict ion t o a wa rd  costs a nd  at t or-
ney™s fees when otherwise warranted.  
Were the statute strictly juris-
dictional, there would be no need to limit awards to ﬁjustﬂ costs; an y 

award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be 
ﬁjust.ﬂ  The Court therefore gives the statute its natural reading: Sec-
tion 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when 

such an award is just.  That standard need not be defined narrowly, 
as the Solicitor General argues, by awarding fees only on a showing 
that the unsuccessful party™s position was frivolous, unreasonable, or 

without foundation.

 v. 
Zipes,
 491 U. S. 754, 762, distin-
guished.The fact that a §1447(c) fee award is discretionary does not 

mean that there is no  go verning legal standard.  When applying fee-
sh ifting statu tes, th e Cour t has found 
limits in ﬁthe large objectivesﬂ of 
the relevan t Act.  
E.g., Zipes
, 491 U. S.
, 
at 759.  The appropriate test 
for awarding fees under §1447(c) shou
ld recognize Congress™ desire to  
deter removals intended to prolong litigation and impose costs on the 
opposing party, while not undermining Congress™ basic decision to af-

ford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the 
statutory criteria are satisfied.  In light of these ﬁlarge objectives,ﬂ 
the standard for awarding fees sh
ould turn on the reasonableness of 
th e removal.  In applying th e general rule of reasonableness,  district 
courts retain discretion to consid
er whether unusual circumstances 
warrant a departure in a given case.  A court™s reasons for departing, 

however, should be ﬁfaithful to the purposesﬂ of awarding fees under 
§1447(c) .
