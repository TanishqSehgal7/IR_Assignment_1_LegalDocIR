Inspector Sir, I do hereby solemnly affirm that upon receiving FOR No.79/495 dated 2-9-2021, the

trees were found to be uprooted with the JCB and small plants of different types were destroyed.
According to FOR, the damage is found to be correct. The accused were issued notice for violating
Section 4 of the PLPA, 1900. But the accused did not give any satisfactory answer. In this FOR, after
preparing PC case of the accused, the same was given to Forest Range Office, Gurugram for
presenting before the Environment Court, Faridabad. This is my statement Sd/-
6. It appears from the materials on record that the Presiding Officer-cum-JMIC, Special
Environment Court Faridabad took cognizance of the complaint, referred to above and issued
process for the offence punishable under Section 19 of the Act, 1900. The order issuing process
reads: -
“DFO Vs Satpal etc Present Sh Gordhan Das, Forester; Gurugram on behalf of the
complainant Heard on the point of summoning of accused In the challan and the
documents attached thereto, it is alleged by the complainant that on 02.09.2021, in

Forest Act, so, same belongs to the Forest Department), the accused destroyed 256
trees using JCB It is also claimed by the complainant that the illegal act committed by
the above named accused, has caused a loss to the tune of Rs 90580/- (Rupees Ninty
Thousand Five Hundred Eighty Only) to the Forest Department.

7. We are informed that the aforesaid complaint bearing CIS No.COMA-134-2024 has now been
transferred to the district Court of Judicial Magistrate-1st Class, Gurugram.
8. It is not in dispute that so far as the appellant no.1 is concerned he is the Managing Director and
Chief Executive Officer of a company namely TATA Realty and Infrastructure Limited and Tata
Housing Development Co. Ltd. So far as the appellant no.2 is concerned, he at the relevant point of
time was the General Manager and is currently the Assistant Vice President of Tata Realty and
Infrastructure Limited in its Corporate Relations Group and so far as the appellant no.3 is
concerned he at the relevant point of time was the erstwhile employee/Senior Manager of the
company namely ‘Sector 113 Gatevida Developers Private Limited’ (formerly known as Lemon Tree
and Developers Private).
Relevant Provisions of Law:
9. Section 4 of the Act, 1900 reads thus:-
“4. Power to regulate, restrict or prohibit, by general or special order, within notified
areas, certain matters.— In respect of areas notified under section 3 generally or the
whole or any part of any such area, the Provincial Government] may, by general or
special order temporarily regulate, restrict or prohibit—
(a) the clearing or breaking up or cultivating of land not ordinarily under cultivation
prior to the publication of the notification under section 3;
(b) the quarrying of stone or the burning of lime at places where such stone or lime
had not ordinarily been so quarried or burnt prior to the publication of the
notification under section 3;
(c) the cutting of trees or timber, or the collection or removal or subjection to any
manufacturing process, otherwise than as described in clause (b) of this sub-section
of any forest-produce other than grass, save for bonafide domestic or agricultural
purposes [of rightholder in such area];
(d) the setting on fire of trees, timber or forest produce;
Sanjay Dutt vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187306114/ 5
(e) the admission, herding, pasturing or retention of sheep,[goats or camels];
(f) the examination of forest-produce passing out of any such area; and
(g) the granting of permits to the inhabitants of towns and villages situate within the
limits or in the vicinity of any such area, to take any tree, timber or forest produce for
their own use therefrom, or to pasture sheep, [goats or camels] or to cultivate or erect
buildings therein and the production and return of such permits by such persons.”
Section 19 of the Act, 1900 reads thus:-
“19. Penalty for offences.— Any person who, within the limits of any area notified
under section 3, commits any breach of any regulation made, [restriction or
prohibition imposed, order passed or requisition made under sections 4, 5, 5-A, or
7-A] shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one
month, or with a fine which may extend to one hundred rupees, or with both”
10. We take notice of the fact that having regard to the Scheme of the Act, 1900, there is no vicarious
liability that can be attached to any of the directors or any office bearers of the company. It is the
individual liability or the act that would make the person concerned liable for being prosecuted for
the offence punishable under Section 19 of the Act, 1900. Having regard to the nature of the
allegations, it is difficult for us to take the view that the appellants herein are responsible for the
alleged offence. There are no allegations worth the name in the complaint that the three appellants
before us are directly responsible for uprooting of the trees with the aid of Bulldozers or JCB
machines or causing damage to the environment. The persons who were actually found at the site
felling the trees have not been arrayed as accused in the complaint. Although the license / necessary
permission for development of the land in the specified area had been granted in favour of the
company, yet for the reasons best known to the complainant the company has not been arrayed as
an accused in the complaint.
11. It appears that the Courts below proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the three
appellants herein being responsible officers of the company are liable for the alleged offence. While
a company may be held liable for the wrongful acts of its employees, the liability of its directors is
not automatic. It depends on specific circumstances, particularly the interplay between the
director’s personal actions and the company’s responsibilities. A director may be vicariously liable
only if the company itself is liable in the first place and if such director personally acted in a manner
that directly connects their conduct to the company’s liability. Mere authorization of an act at the
behest of the company or the exercise of a supervisory role over certain actions or activities of the
company is not enough to render a director vicariously liable. There must exist something to show
that such actions of the director stemmed from their personal involvement and arose from actions
or conduct falling outside the scope of its routine corporate duties. Thus, where the company is the
offender, vicarious liability of the Directors cannot be imputed automatically, in the absence of any
statutory provision to this effect. There has to be a specific act attributed to the director or any other
person allegedly in control and management of the company, to the effect that such a person was
responsible for the acts committed by or on behalf of the company.
Sanjay Dutt vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025

12. At the same time, wherever by a legal fiction the principle of vicarious liability is attracted and a
person who is otherwise not personally involved in the commission of an offence is made liable for
the same, it has to be specifically provided in the statute concerned. When it comes to penal
provisions, vicarious liability of the managing director and director would arise provided any
provision exists in that behalf in the statute. Even where such provision for fastening vicarious
liability exists, it does not mean that any and all directors of the company would be automatically
liable for any contravention of such statute. Vicarious Liability would arise only if there are specific
and substantiated allegations attributing a particular role or conduct to such director, sufficient
enough to attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability and by extension the offence itself.
13. It is the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that there is no vicarious liability unless the
statute specifically provides so. Thus, an individual who has perpetrated the commission of an
offence on behalf of a company can be made an accused, if the statute provides for such liability and
if there is sufficient evidence of his active role coupled with criminal intent. The primary
responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as are required under the law in the
complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable. For fastening criminal liability on an officer
of a company, there is no presumption that every officer of a company knows about the transaction
in question.
14. The allegations which find place against the appellants herein in their personal capacity seem to
be absolutely vague. When a complainant intends to rope in a Managing Director or any officer of a
company, it is essential to make requisite allegations to constitute the various liability.
15. When jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint petition filed in terms of Section 156(3) or Section
200 of the CrPC, the Court concerned should remain vigilant & apply its mind carefully before
taking cognizance of a complaint of the present nature.
16. The High Court failed to pose unto itself the correct question i.e., as to whether the complaint
even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety would lead to the conclusion that the
appellants herein were personally liable for the offence under Section 4 of the Act, 1900 made
punishable under Section 19 of the Act, 1900.
17. In Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and Anr., v. Datar Switchgear
Limited and Ors., as reported in (2010) 10 SCC 479, wherein, the Chairman of the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board was made an accused for the offence under Sections 192 and 199 respectively
read with Section 34 of the IPC, this Court observed thus:
“30. It is trite law that wherever by a legal fiction the principle of vicarious liability is
attracted and a person who is otherwise not personally involved in the commission of
an offence is made liable for the same, it has to be specifically provided in the statute
concerned. In our opinion, neither Section 192 IPC nor Section 199 IPC incorporate
the principle of vicarious liability, and therefore, it was incumbent on the
complainant to specifically aver the role of each of the accused in the complaint. It
would be profitable to extract the following observations made in S.K. Alagh: (SCC
Sanjay Dutt vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187306114/ 7
p.667, para 19) “19. As, admittedly, drafts were drawn in the name of the company,
even if the appellant was its Managing Director, he cannot be said to have committed
an offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code. If and when a statute contemplates
creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In absence of any
provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a company or an employee
cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence committed by the company
itself.” (Emphasis supplied)
18. In such circumstances, referred to above, no case could be said to have been made out for
putting the three appellants to trial for the alleged offence. The Court concerned could not have
issued process for the alleged offence.
19. In view of the aforesaid, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned complaint
and order taking cognizance of the said complaint is hereby quashed.
20. We clarify that if it is the case of the department that the company has committed any breach or
violation of any of the conditions imposed at the time of grant of license, then it is always open for
authority concerned to proceed against the company for violation of such terms and conditions.
21. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
