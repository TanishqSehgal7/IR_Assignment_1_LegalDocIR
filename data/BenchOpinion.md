MARTIN ET UX v. FRANKLIN CAPITAL CORP. 
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 04ñ1140. Argued November 8, 2005óDecided December 7, 2005 
In removing petitioner Martinsí state-court class action to federal court 
on diversity grounds, respondents (collectively, Franklin) acknowl-
edged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of 
the state-court complaint, but argued that this requirement for fed-
eral diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied under precedent 
suggesting that punitive damages and attorneyís fees could be aggre-
gated in making the calculation. The District Court denied the Mar-
tinsí motion to remand to state court and eventually dismissed the 
case with prejudice. Reversing and remanding with instructions to 
remand to state court, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins 
that their suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy require-
ment and rejected Franklinís aggregation theory under decisions is-
sued after the District Courtís remand decision. The latter court then 
denied the Martinsí motion for attorneyís fees because Franklin had 
legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within federal-court ju-
risdiction. Affirming, the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the Martinsí 
argument that attorneyís fees should be granted on remand as a mat-
ter of course under 28 U. S. C. ß1447(c), which provides that a re-
mand order ìmay require payment of just costs and any actual ex-
penses, including attorney fees,î but provides little guidance on when 
fees are warranted. The court noted that fee awards are left to the 
district courtís discretion, subject to review only for abuse of discre-
tion; pointed out that, under Circuit precedent, the key factor in de-
ciding whether to award fees is the propriety of removal; and held 
that, because Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held 
to be unsound, its basis for removal was objectively reasonable, and 
the fee denial was not an abuse of discretion. 
Held: Absent unusual circumstances, attorneyís fees should not be 
awarded under ß1447(c) when the removing party has an objectively 
reasonable basis for removal. Conversely, where no objectively rea-
sonable basis exists, fees should be awarded. This Court rejects the 
Martinsí argument for adopting a strong presumption in favor of 
awarding fees. The reasons for adopting such a presumption in 
Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (per cu-
riam), are absent here. Also rejected is Franklinís argument that 
ß1447(c) simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attor-
neyís fees when otherwise warranted. Were the statute strictly juris-
dictional, there would be no need to limit awards to ìjustî costs; any 
award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be 
ìjust.î The Court therefore gives the statute its natural reading: Sec-
tion 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when 
such an award is just. That standard need not be defined narrowly, 
as the Solicitor General argues, by awarding fees only on a showing 
that the unsuccessful partyís position was frivolous, unreasonable, or 
without foundation. Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 
412, 422, and Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 762, distin-
guished. The fact that a ß1447(c) fee award is discretionary does not 
mean that there is no governing legal standard. When applying fee-
shifting statutes, the Court has found limits in ìthe large objectivesî of 
the relevant Act. E.g., Zipes, 491 U. S., at 759. The appropriate test 
for awarding fees under ß1447(c) should recognize Congressí desire to 
deter removals intended to prolong litigation and impose costs on the 
opposing party, while not undermining Congressí basic decision to af-
ford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the 
statutory criteria are satisfied. In light of these ìlarge objectives,î 
the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of 
the removal. In applying the general rule of reasonableness, district 
courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances 
warrant a departure in a given case. A courtís reasons for departing, 
however, should be ìfaithful to the purposesî of awarding fees under 
ß1447(c). Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 534, n. 19. Pp. 3ñ9. 
393 F. 3d 1143, affirmed.
